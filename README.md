**Note**: this software is still in early alpha and is not fully featured, and
will probably break on you.

Kapit is a program that runs in your terminal and allows you to run HTTP
commands. While not nearly as full featured as [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) or
libraries (like [request](https://github.com/request/request)) it has a few
features that I felt the other API testing programs were lacking.

### Reasons

* I wanted a client that saved all state so I can launch it later and have all
of my inputs and outputs the same as when I left.
* I wanted to include [Paw](https://luckymarmot.com/paw)'s feature of using
parts of other requests in new requests.
* I wanted to setup a chain of requests that all build on one another.
* I wanted to include
[Webdriver](http://docs.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) support so we can
handle fancy OAuth 2.0 flows that require browser use.
* I'm not afraid of using my
[favorite editor](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) to edit JSON. I'm ok
editing request bodies like this, and using this for many advanced options.
* I wanted simple options to be accessible with single key presses.

### Alternatives

* [Postman](http://www.getpostman.com/) - Chrome Extension
* [Paw](https://luckymarmot.com/paw) - Mac Desktop App
* [curl](http://curl.haxx.se/) - Command line tool

### What I Used

This client uses [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) for the UI and
[request](https://github.com/request/request) as an HTTP node library. Other
node dependencies can be seen in our
[package.json](https://github.com/kelsin/kapit/blob/master/package.json) file.

I use [groc](https://github.com/nevir/groc) to document my code and
[mocha](http://mochajs.org/), [chai](http://chaijs.com/),
[sinon](http://sinonjs.org/), and
[istanbul](http://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/) to test it.

## Overview

Kapit saves all of it's data in one file that defaults to
`~/.kapit/state.json`. If you want you can have many files with kapit states by
starting kapit with a different file.

In one file you can create many chains. Chains can each hold many steps which
represent one request each.

The main window of kapit shows your current chain on the top, the current step's
request data on the left, and the response on the right. You hit keybindings
that help you edit various parts of your step's request. When your finally ready
you can hit `x` to run the step and see the response.

The real power comes from when you chain multiple requests together allowing you
to follow discoverable APIs or handle authentication easily.

## Usage

### Templates

Any piece of data in the request is run through
[handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) before being used. This means any piece
of json data or field that is a string can use data from any other request in
your chain. Any data in the current context can be used in your handlebars
requests and you can view the context by hitting `Ctrl-c`.

So if I have a step named `Token` that has the following body:

``` json
{
  "token": 12345
}
```

I can use it as part of my header in a new step by:

1. focusing the new step
2. hitting `h` to edit a header
3. typing in `Authorization` to say which header I'm editing
4. entering: `Bearer {{Token.response.body.token}}`

Since Kapit will convert the body of the `Token` request to json we can pull out
exactly what we need. If you requests have spaces in the name or arrays you can
still use handlebars to get them out with strings like
`{{[Name with space].list.5.item}}`. You should check out
[Handlebars documentation](http://handlebarsjs.com/expressions.html) for more
details.

### Webdriver Support

Webdriver support is very wonky at the moment while I work on an interface. I
have it working, but it's not very usable for generic situations yet.

### Keybindings

Here are the basic keybindings

|Key|Function|
|---|--------|
|`q`|Quit|
|`s`|Save state. *This will most like be automatic very soon|
|`?`|Display Help|
|`C`|New Chain|
|`N`|New Step|
|`D`|Delete Step|
|`Ctrl-n`|Next Step|
|`Ctrl-p`|Previous Step|
|`c`|Edit chain name|
|`n`|Edit step name|
|`t`|Edit step type|
|`tab`|Switch focus from the request to the response|
|`w`|View request/response raw JSON objects, instead of formatted text|
|`Ctrl-c`|View the context JSON blob that's available for variables *_editor_|
|`b`|Edit request body *_editor_|
|`d`|Edit request data *_editor_|
|`f`|Edit request form data *_editor_|
|`h`|Edit request header|
|`m`|Edit request method|
|`o`|Toggle request json format|
|`u`|Edit url|
|`x`|Execute current step|
|`r`|Reset current step|
|`R`|Reset all steps|

When you're focused on a window that can scroll you can use the following keys
to do so:

|Key|Function|
|---|--------|
|`j`|Down one line|
|`k`|Up one line|
|`Ctrl-d`|Down one page|
|`Ctrl-u`|Up one page|
|`g`|Go to beginning|
|`G`|Go to end|

## TODO

* I'm thinking about removing all in terminal editors and just having the main
  interface be editing the json blogs in your editor of choice. Will decide
  after more use.

## Installation

First make sure you have a recent version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed and then run:

    npm install -g kapit

You can then run with:

    kapit

Kapit will use the default config file of `~/.kapit/state.json` but you can pass
another file on the command line if you wish:

    kapit another-file.json

### Webdriver Support

If you want to use PhantomJS or Chrome Webdriver you need to install them. On Mac OSX this can be done with brew:

    brew install phantomjs
    brew install chromedriver

## Development

Checkout and install all dependencies:

    git clone git@github.com:kelsin/kapit.git
    cd kapit
    npm install

You can then run the tests:

    npm test

Or build the documentation:

    groc
